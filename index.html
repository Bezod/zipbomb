            <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <p>
                EarthMC is a minecraft server with a "real" custom earth map. This guide will get you started on your adventure. Once you join, open the server world map in your browser by clicking the link: <a href="https://map.earthmc.xyz">map.earthmc.xyz</a>. You can view other towns you want to join or take coordinates of the map to find a place you want to settle. Gold ingots are used as currency and referred to as just "gold" or G for short. You get gold from mining and voting for the server by running <strong>/vote</strong> and then clicking on the links displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also need to know how to create vaults. Vaults store your gold. In order to create a vault you need a chest and a sign. Hold down "shift" on your keyboard and place your sign on the chest. on the first line write: <strong>[vault]</strong> with square brackets included. Type <strong>[town vault]</strong> on a sign to create a town vault. You can deposit gold from you inventory <strong>/deposit</strong> or pay someone from your vault <strong>/pay</strong>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="town">Creating a town</h2>
            <p>
                In order to create a town you need 16 gold in your inventory. Make sure your stand in the area you want to settle your town in before running the command. Once you're ready, open chat and type:
                <br>
                <strong>/t new (townnamehere)</strong>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Towns are safe from raiding and looting. Towns can only be raided during war day. Read more about war further down. Mayors (player that created the town) can toggle taxes, pvp ect. <br>
                     Do <strong>/t toggle</strong> for more info.
                </p>
            </p>
            <h3>Adding members to your town</h3>
            <p>In order to add people to your town run <strong>/t add (playername)</strong></p>
            <h3>Expanding your town</h3>
            <p>
                Costs 10 gold. <strong>Gold must be in town vault</strong> (chest labaled [town vault]) in order to run the command. Command: <strong>/t claim</strong>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="nation">Creating a nation</h2>
            <p>
                A nation is a collection of towns with one town as the capital. Nations can fight in wars and collect taxes from towns within the nation. You need 64 gold to create a nation <strong>/n new (nationnamehere)</strong>.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="war">War day</h2>
            <p>
                War day can only be started by the admin "Fix". <strong>Make sure to join our discord channel to know when a war day is coming up!</strong>. Nations can fight in wars. Towns not in nations can not participate and they are safe from attackers. Nations can be neutral in wars by paying a fee of 32 gold. To see war progress, use the command <strong>/t war</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                All towns have "health" during war. Normal town blocks (16x16 minecraft block aka chunks, marked red on server world map) has 60 health points (HP). Home block has 120 HP. You town lose HP when enemies stand within the block. You can only attack blocks connected to wilderness first. When one of your town blocks are under attack a firework will appear above.
            </p>
            <p>
                The war ends when all other nations are defeated or when Fix toggels war off. You will get your claimed land back afterwards although the greifing is permanant.

            <h2 id="donate">Donator rank</h2>
            <p>Hosting a server costs money, time and energy. If you enjoy what I do, please consider donating. I don't sell any gameplay benefits like most servers because I believe it's unfair. However, you get some awesome cosmetic features listed below and most importantly you help the server to stay alive.</p>
