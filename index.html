            <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <p>
                EarthMC is a minecraft server with a "real" custom earth map. This guide will get you started on
                your adventure. Once you join, open the server world map in your browser by clicking the link: <a href="https://map.earthmc.xyz">map.earthmc.xyz</a>.</br>
                </br>
                You can view other towns you want to join or check coordinates on the map to find a place you want
                to settle in. Gold ingots are used as currency and referred to as just "gold" or G for short. You get
                gold from mining and voting for the server by doing <strong>/vote</strong> and then clicking on the links displayed.
            </p>

            <h2 id="town">Creating a town</h2>
            <p>
                In order to create a town you need 16 gold. Make sure you stand in the area you
                want to settle your town in before running the command. Once you're ready, open chat and type: <strong>/t new (name)</strong><br />
                <br />
                Towns are safe from raiding and looting while not in a nation. Read more about war further down.
                Mayors (player that created the town) can toggle taxes, pvp, firespread ect. <br />
                Do <strong>/t toggle</strong> for more info.
            </p>
            <h3>Adding members to your town:</h3>
            <p>
                In order to add people to your town do <strong>/t add (player)</strong>
            </p>
            <h3>Expanding your town:</h3>
            <p>
                Costs 16 gold for each plot. <strong>Gold is taken from the town vault</strong>. Command: <strong>/t claim</strong>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="nation">Creating a nation</h2>
            <p>
                A nation is a collection of towns with one town as the capital. Nations can fight in wars and collect
                taxes from towns within the nation. Towns may leave the nation whenever they wish. You need 64 gold to create a nation, taken from the town vault, using <strong>/n new (name)</strong>.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="nation">Vaults</h2>
            <p>
                Vaults are chests that act as your bank account, many of the server's economy commands can use this gold without you having to carry it with you.<br />
                <br />
                In order to create one you
                need a chest and a sign. Place your sign on the chest with shift-rightclick and on the first line type <strong>[vault]</strong> with the square brackets included.<br />
                <br />
                Type <strong>[town vault]</strong> on the sign to create a town vault or <strong>[nation vault]</strong> to create a nation vault. You can deposit gold from your inventory or personal vault to
                town vaults with <strong>/t deposit</strong> and withdraw with <strong>/t withdraw</strong>. Same thing with nation vaults.
            </p>

            <h2 id="war">Wars</h2>
            <p>
                Wars may seem complicated and overwhelming at first. If you’re new and in a neutral town, you could skip this part for now.<br />
                <br />
                A nation can take plots from another by placing a “war flag” inside of their territory.<br />
                <br />
                You need to do /n enemy add (nation) to be able to attack the nation. Once you have done
                this, you and your people will be able to place a fence in their border territory which will create the war flag for 5
                gold. A player can only plant a single flag at a time and needs to have the gold in their personal vault.
                This war flag will get a flashing block of wool on top of it and a floating 3x3 cube of wool far
                above it in the sky to show the residents of the town where you are attacking.<br />
                <br />
                If the enemy manages to destroy your flag, you will lose the fight and have to pay 15 additional
                gold to the defenders. To win the fight you have to hold on for 3 minutes.<br />
                <br />
                Remember, as soon as you declare an enemy they
                will also be able to attack you. To be able to attack a town there must be at least 2 players online
                in that town and at least 3 in total in their nation. Kicking/inviting players to be immune after
                attacking is not allowed, report to staff if you see this happening.

            <h2 id="donate">Donator rank</h2>
            <p>
                Hosting a server costs money, time and energy. If you'd like to help out you can donate below. All
                money will go towards the server and the costs associated with hosting it. I don't sell any
                gameplay benefits because not only is it unfair but also against the minecraft server EULA.<br />
                <br />
                However, you get some awesome cosmetic features listed below and most importantly you help
                the server keep running. Thanks for helping out, this is what you get in return:
